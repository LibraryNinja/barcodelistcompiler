# barcodelistcompiler
Takes folder of Word .docx files with item barcodes, and outputs a single .txt file with all of them 

I was getting several .docx files a day from staff of barcodes of items that were for batch processing with Alma. Alma wants file uploads for sets to be a .txt file with a header of the ID type (in this case, barcode). I was manually copying the data from all of the separate files into a single .txt. This automates it.

It's here in its original Jupyter Notebook form with comments. 

I may add the version I use now at some point (which also adds those barcodes to a set in Alma directly).
